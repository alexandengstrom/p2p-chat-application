# P2P Chat Application

This repo contains a P2P (peer-to-peer) chat app that my partner and I built using C#. The project was part of the course TDDD49 at LinkÃ¶ping University. The goal of this course was to learn more about C#, Visual Studio, and the MVVM design pattern.

Our chat app allows people to talk to each other directly over the internet without needing a central server. It's a true peer-to-peer setup, meaning that chats are private and happen directly between users' own internet connections.

### Key Features
* **Choose Your Network Endpoint**: Users can start the application by selecting an IP address and port to listen for incoming chat requests.

* **Send and Receive Chat Requests**: Once set up, users can send chat requests to others knowing their IP and port, and also receive incoming requests.

* **Simultaneous Conversations**: The application supports having multiple chat conversations simultaneously.

* **Local Conversation Storage**: All chats are stored locally in JSON format.

* **Reconnect Feature**: When a conversation is no longer active, a reconnect button will be visible.
